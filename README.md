# Programming Language Ecosystem

Welcome to the **ELP Project** repository\! This collection features three distinct applications, each developed using a major programming language from a different ecosystem: **Elm**, **Go (Golang)**, and **JavaScript (Node.js)**. This index serves to explore varied approaches to development, covering domains from **functional programming (using Elm)**, **concurrent server architectures (using Go)**, and the use of a **web language (JavaScript)** for console-based game logic.

For comprehensive details on setup, running instructions, and code architecture, please refer to the dedicated `README.md` file located within each project's directory.

| Project Directory | Technology | Primary Focus / Function | 
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[elm/](https://www.google.com/search?q=elm/README.md)** | Elm (Functional Front-End) | The primary goal was to explore a **functional programming language** for front-end web visualization. | 
| **[go\_project/](https://www.google.com/search?q=go_project/README.md)** | Go (Backend/Server) | **Shortest Paths Project:** Server-client architecture implementing all-pairs shortest paths (N x Dijkstra) on graph data **using Go**. |
| **[js/](https://www.google.com/search?q=js/README.md)** | JavaScript (Node.js) | **JustOne (Console Game):** The goal was to use a **web language (JavaScript)** for console-based cooperative party game implementation. |
